# Financial Statement Report Project

I recently completed a project that involved analyzing the sales of pharmaceutical products using Microsoft Power BI. 
The project focused on a specific product, Durant, and analyzed its sales over the last 5 years, as well as the performance of the sales team in 2022. 
The project required a variety of skills, including data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis, as well as a strong understanding of Microsoft Power BI.
In addition, I utilized my expertise in data modeling, and dashboard design to create a comprehensive and visually appealing analysis of the sales data. 
Overall, this project showcases my ability to work with similar datasets and use data visualization tools to gain insights and inform business decisions.

The report is designed to answer the following key questions:

Which products were the top performers in terms of sales, and which products were the least successful? <br>
What was the performance of "Bestpro" sales team in 2022?<br>
How did sales of the pharmaceutical product "Bestpro" vary across different geographic regions?<br>

Commentary: <br>
The Power BI dashboard effectively depicts the evolution of the pharmaceutical market, including the positioning of various products. 
It provides in-depth analysis of the sales performance of Bestpro product in comparison to other competitors in the market.
Furthermore, the dashboard sheds light on the strategies implemented by the Bestpro sales team in response to the changes in the market.
For a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of Bestpro's strategies and their forecasting, we can apply statistical analysis and build a report
