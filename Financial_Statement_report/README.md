# Financial Statement Report Project

This project is a financial statement report that provides a comprehensive analysis of a company's financial performance. 
The data source for this project was connected using Azure Data Lake Gen 2, and the data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query. 
It includes various visualizations such as bar charts, Matrix, and Cards to represent the financial data in a clear and easy-to-understand format. 
The report also includes a summary section that highlights key metrics such as revenue, expenses, and net income.

The report is designed to answer the following key questions:

What was the company's financial performance in 2019 and 2020?<br>
What were the key drivers of the company's financial performance in 2019 and 2020?<br>
What are the potential risks and opportunities for the company's financial future?<br>

Commentary: <br>
This is a commentary about the balance sheet data for the company in 2019 and 2020. The data suggests that the company had strong financial performance in 2019, with a positive net earnings and a healthy bank balance. However, in 2020 the company faced financial difficulties, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors.

It's important to note that this commentary is based only on the balance sheet data and does not provide a complete picture of the company's financial situation. 
To gain a full understanding of the company's financial performance and extract additional insights, it would be helpful to explore the full Power BI financial report, which may include other data and trends over time.
